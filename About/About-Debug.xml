	<description>Inspired by the excellent too many buttons mod, this mod provides a simple way to hide all of the stuff cluttering up the build menus that you're never going to
		build so you can reserve all that screen real estate for the 37 types of door that you simply cannot do without.
(This is the dev version of I Aint Building That. The release version of About.xml is available for editing at About/About-Release.xml. Edits made on this file or on the temporary About/About.xml won't show up on the release version. Use VisualStudio to build a "Release" version of this mod when ready to upload your mod!)</description>
